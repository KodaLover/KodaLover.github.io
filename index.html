    <h2>Mica Garcia</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Mica Garcia. I have worked for Rio Salado since 2010, starting off as an instructor for the
        Avondale Instructional Team. I have started with my first semester teaching the course on my own in January 2023
        and have helped develop the course itself. I enjoy working with HTML to create functional websites and have fun
        using CSS to make them visually pleasing!</p>
    <p>Due to the nature of web design, I try to keep up with the latest trends and updates, brushing up on what's
        available through online tutorials (like W3Schools) and classes offered through Rio. I'm excited to continue
        sharing the knowledge I've learned in the industry to instruct students!
