        <h2>A REFUGE IN THE SMALLEST OF PLACES</h2>
        <p>By Joy Harjo</p>
        <p>Someone sang for me and no one else could hear it<br>
            When I had given up and made knife marks on my arm<br>
            Or drank and gave myself away or was given</p>
            
        <p>Someone sang for me and no one else could hear it<br>
            <em>When demons came with rope and cages<br>
            To take my children from me and imprison us</em></p>
            <!-- The importance of this line is the history that comes with it -->
            
        <p>Someone sang for me and no one else could hear it<br>
            Now I am here in the timeless room of lost poetry<br>
            Gathering up the destroyed and forgotten<br>
            Because of the songs someone sang that no one else could hear</p>
            
        <p>But me.</p>
